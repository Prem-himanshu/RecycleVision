✅ RecycleVision – AI-Powered Garbage Classification

♻️ RecycleVision is a deep-learning–based waste classification system that identifies garbage across 6, 10, and 12 categories using MobileNetV2, transfer learning, and a custom-built Streamlit web app.

This project helps automate waste segregation, enabling better recycling and environmental sustainability.

🚀 Features

✔ Classify waste into 6, 10, or 12 classes
✔ Uses MobileNetV2 (lightweight + accurate)
✔ Fully functional Streamlit web app
✔ Training pipelines for each dataset
✔ Preprocessing & augmentation included
✔ Supports custom image uploads
✔ Real-time confidence score
✔ Clean & modular code structure

🧠 Model Architecture

All models use:

MobileNetV2 (pretrained on ImageNet)

Global Average Pooling layer

Dropout (0.3 – 0.4)

Dense Softmax output

Adam optimizer

Categorical Crossentropy

🏋️ Training Instructions
Train 6-Class Model
python train_6.py

Train 10-Class Model
python train_10.py

Train 12-Class Model
python train_12.py


Each script automatically:

✔ Loads data
✔ Augments images
✔ Trains + validates
✔ Saves best model as:
model_6_class.h5, model_10_class.h5, model_12_class.h5

🔍 Prediction Scripts

Predict using:

predict_6.py
predict_10.py
predict_12.py


Each file contains:

✔ Image preprocessing
✔ Loading correct model
✔ Returning predicted class & confidence

🌐 Streamlit App

Run the web application:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py


App Features:

Upload any garbage image

Choose model: 6 / 10 / 12 class

Shows prediction + confidence score

Beautiful minimal interface
